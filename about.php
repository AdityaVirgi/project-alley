      <h3>Our Story</h3>
      <p>
        Founded in 2022, Kopi Pesan began with a simple idea: to make enjoying quality coffee more convenient.
        Our founder, a passionate coffee enthusiast, noticed how much time people spent waiting in line at coffee
        shops and wanted to create a solution.
      </p>
      <p>
        The answer was an integrated reservation and ordering system that allows customers to reserve tables,
        pre-order their favorite drinks, and enjoy a hassle-free experience at our coffee shop.
